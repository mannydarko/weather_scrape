# Surfing in Costa Rica

* The purpose of this project was to create a web page the will display the weather in Costa Rica as well as the time and date using Python and Flask.

* We used "surfline" (https://www.surfline.com/surf-reports-forecasts-cams/costa-rica/3624060) grab the names of location as well as the height of the surf. For example "Camaronal has 6-7 FT surf"

It entails:

* A `app.py` file serves as a router and will use a python `scrape_weather.py` file to scrape the data.

* Storage of every scrape into a database.

* The webpage will display all the results from the database.
